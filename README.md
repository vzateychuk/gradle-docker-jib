# Dockerizing Java Apps using Jib

Jib is an open-source Java tool maintained by Google for building Docker images of Java applications. It simplifies containerization since with it, we don't need to write a dockerfile.

And actually, we don't even have to have docker installed to create and publish the docker images ourselves.
